# Danilo Felipe
<sub>*Data Scientist*</sub>

I have a degree in Computer Engineering, where I started studying machine learning and since then my love for the insights we can take based on data has only grown.

I have mastery of all stages of developing a business solution using the concepts and tools of Data Science, from understanding the business to publishing the model in production using Clouds.

I have already developed solutions for important business problems such as detecting Sales Forecasting, identifying customers in churn and prioritizing customers for cross-selling.

The details of each solution are described in the projects below.


**Analytical Tools:** 

**Data Collect and Storage:** SQL, MySQL, SQL Server.

**Data Processing and Analysis:** R and Python.

**Development:** Git, Scrum and CRISP-DM

**Data Vizualization:**  Power BI.

**Machine Learning Modeling:** Classification, Regression, Clustering, Time Series, Reinforcement Learning and NLP. 

**Machine Learning Deployment:** AWS Cloud and Heroku

## Data Science Projects:

### [Rossmann Store Sales]( https://github.com/danilofneto/Rossmann-Store-Sales )

Building a Machine Learning Model to sales is a common and essential use in data science.

In this project, i developed a Machine Learning model able to forescat sales with Mean Absolute Percentage error accuracy(MAPE): 0.13 +/- 0.02. The performance of this model would increase revenue of R$4 millions according to the company's business model described in the problem definition.


### [Churn Prediciton]( https://github.com/danilofneto/Churn_Predict ) 

In saturated markets, the cost to retain a customer is much less than prospecting for new customers. Machine Learning models are able to predict whether or not the customer will renew their service contract with the company in the next year. This information about the users is very important to optimize efforts in prioritizing customers who should continue with the contract in the company.
In this context, I developed a Machine Learning algorithm to identify whether or not a customer will stop using the banking service. The performance of the model in identifying the customer who will enter in churn period is **86%**, which represents an additional **U$ 16 million in revenue**, as described in the project.

### [Health Insurance Cross-Sell]( https://github.com/danilofneto/cross_sell )
